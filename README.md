PyCrack
==========
                
PyCrack's goal is to become a crypto-analytic framework able to :
* help identify usual cipher;
* help decrypt (if possible) usual cipher;
* and cipher-decipher when common algorithms are not implemented 

For now it's focusing on deciphering automatically classic algorithms.

List of Ciphers supported
----------
* Caesar : Allow anyone to test various shifts
* Vigenere : Automatically decipher encrypted text

How to use
----------
Just launch ui.py, and you'll be able to use the automatic crackers using Command line
